                  So long and thanks for all the fish! Let’s say goodbye to our last night on the ship in style. Kigu-style that is. Kigu’s not required but good vibes are!

                  This will also be the last turn-in opportunity for the Official CCC Scavenger hunt.

                  “One time at X-con”. Here’s the place to relive and share your past horror stories over your convention years. Tell us about the time that you had to drag a drunk guy in a wagon back to his room. Or about when you realized that a “Tied up” panel was not about time management a little too late. Let’s commiserate together.
